	<p>When people hear YA novels, they think only a certain age range should be reading those books. Even though those books have a "target" audience, it does not mean that audience needs to be limited.

	<p><strong> Look at what <i>Publishers Weekly</i> has to say! </strong></p>
	
	<p> "Young adulthood is formative and young adult literature is potent—changing alongside culture and society. It is exactly this dynamism of form and content that draws many writers to YA, Gansworth notes. PW spoke with [Eric] Gansworth and seven other authors about why they write for teens." (Makhjani, 2022) The article contines on to highlight other authors and books to describe key things YA books currently do: crossing genres, truth telling, and more!

	<p><strong> Look at what the <i> Richmond Public Library</i> has to say! </strong></p>
	<p> "YA literature is also reflective of a diverse group of authors and characters.  What was once a collection of books by and about straight white women has thankfully grown to be a rainbow of authors and characters.  Many teens of color, indigenous teens, LGBT teens, teens living in poverty, or teens with disabilities first saw a character like themselves in a YA book.  Furthermore, the authors themselves have become role-models, also mirroring these teens in gender, race, and orientation.  Maybe even more importantly, today’s YA literature provides an opportunity for teens to read about characters unlike themselves, building their capacity for understanding, empathy, and compassion for others." (Deuell, 2020)

	<p><strong> Look at what <i>The Daily North Western</i> has to say! </strong></p>
	
	<p> "However, I insist that YA has caused a revival of literature and has succeeded in preventing books from becoming irrelevant in an era of mass entertainment channels. It is very hard to develop an interest in literature when a story is just a Netflix account away . . . What defines what is good literature and what is not?" (Sastoque, 2020)
